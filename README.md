# Amazon Backend Project ![Amazon Icon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Amazon_logo.svg)

## Project Overview:
Amazon is a practice project designed to enhance backend development skills. The project focuses on building a **RESTful API** to better understand backend principles and enhance knowledge of Go programming.

### Technologies & Tools:
- **Frontend**: Primarily developed during the Super Simple Dev course (JavaScript). *(Temporary removal of frontend for backend focus)*
- **Backend**: Built using **Go** to explore the intricacies of **REST API** development.
- **Framework**: Initially using **Go Fiber** for its lightweight nature and performance. Future consideration for **Gin** as Fiber lacks OAuth support.

## Current Progress:
- REST API is under development with core functionalities in place.
- Basic API features like CRUD operations are operational.

## Future Goals:
- Complete REST API with fully functional endpoints.
- Implement authentication features: login, logout, user management, and token handling.
- Improve scalability and security with OAuth support.

Feel free to contribute or provide feedback as the project progresses!
