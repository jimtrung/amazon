# Amazon Backend Project 🚀🔧🖥️

## Project Overview:
Amazon is a practice project designed to enhance backend development skills. The project focuses on building a **RESTful API** to better understand backend principles and enhance knowledge of Go programming. 

### Technologies & Tools: 
- **Frontend**: Primarily developed during the Super Simple Dev course (JavaScript). *(Temporary removal of frontend for backend focus)* 🖥️
- **Backend**: Built using **Go** to explore the intricacies of **REST API** development. 🏗️
- **Framework**: Initially using **Go Fiber** for its lightweight nature and performance. ⚡ Future consideration for **Gin** as Fiber lacks OAuth support. 🔒

## Current Progress:
- REST API is under development with core functionalities in place. 🚧
- Basic API features like CRUD operations are operational. 🔄

## Future Goals:
- Complete REST API with fully functional endpoints. 🎯
- Implement authentication features: login, logout, user management, and token handling. 🔑
- Improve scalability and security with OAuth support. 🔐
