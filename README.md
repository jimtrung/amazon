# Amazon Backend Project 🚀🔧🖥️

## Project Overview:
Amazon is a practice project designed to enhance backend development skills. The project focuses on building a **RESTful API** to better understand backend principles and deepen knowledge of Go programming.

### Technologies & Tools:
- **Frontend**: Initially developed during the Super Simple Dev course (JavaScript). *(Temporarily removed to focus on backend development.)* 🖥️  
- **Backend**: Built using **Go** to explore the intricacies of **REST API** development. 🏗️  
- **Framework**: Currently using **Gin** for its performance, simplicity, and built-in support for authentication (OAuth, JWT, etc.). 🔥  
- **Database**: **PostgreSQL** is being used to store and manage data effectively. 🗄️  
- **Logger**: **Zap** is being used for efficient logging. 📊  
- **API Documentation**: **Swagger** is being used to document the API endpoints. 📜  

## Current Progress:
- REST API development is ongoing, with core functionalities in place. 🚧  
- Basic API features like CRUD operations are operational. 🔄  

## Future Goals:
- Complete the REST API with fully functional endpoints. 🎯  
- Implement authentication features: login, logout, user management, and token handling. 🔑  
- Enhance security and scalability with OAuth support. 🔐
